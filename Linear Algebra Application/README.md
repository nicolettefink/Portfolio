# Linear Algebra Desktop Application

This is a desktop applicaiton written for my calculus 3 course. We were required to implement some of the linear algebra calculations/algorithms we had learned throughout the course. Instead of having mine run from the command line, I created an interface where the user could input data. The application is written in Java and thus requires the jdk for compiling/running it. Application.java is the file that contains the main method.

The application is capable of running the following algorithms:
* QR Factorization
* Gauss-Newton Method (using QR)
* Power Method (graphing the results)
* Animation (using linear transformations)

Readme.txt contains instructions on how to input and format the data for each algorithm.

** Plot.java, Pic.java, Pixel.java are not mine. The rest of the files are, however.**
